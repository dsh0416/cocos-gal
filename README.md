# Cocos-gal
IPA ['kəukəus ɡæluː]
## What is Cocos-gal
Cocos-gal is a DSL(Domain Specific Language) to create interactive fiction game(eg. galgame) in a very fast and easy way. Cocos-gal behaves as a library of cocos2d-js, so that you still could use almost every feature in cocos2d to make your choice of using this library with no side effects.

## Why We Make Cocos-gal
The truth is that we are making an interactive fiction game, but we can hardly find a game engine that meets our modern needs, or they are making the easy job into complex ones. So that, we decide to build a game engine of our own.  

## Features
1. Very Easy Syntax
2. Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS Supported
3. No Injection, No Side Effects to Cocos2d-js
4. High Performance
5. Built-in Game Saving Features
