# How to contribute
What the src actually contains is a demo cocos2d-js project.
It helps developers to design and test the framework under a real project.
The framework distribution would be finally extracted through a bash shell.

But any cocos2d-js project would contains its own framework files which are too large and make no sense to this project.
So that we've put anything about the cocos2d-js framework files into git ignore files list, and they would not be uploaded to the git server.

If you want to contribute, you'd better download these ignored files through any of the mirrors below and unachieved to the src/cocos-gal folder, to make your project runnable for your own testing.
